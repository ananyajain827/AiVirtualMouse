AI Virtual Mouse 🖱️🤖 is an innovative gesture-based system that lets users control their computer’s mouse using only hand gestures — no physical mouse needed! 🖐️💻 It uses a regular webcam 🎥 to track finger positions in real time and translates them into cursor movement and click actions on the screen.
